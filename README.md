# Microplastic-Segmentation-GAN

Current methods for microplastic identification in water samples are costly and require expert analysis. Here, we propose a deep learning segmentation model to automatically identify microplastic in microscopic images. We obtain images from the Moore Institute for Plastic Pollution Research and employ a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to supplement and generate diverse training data. To verify the diversity of the data we conducted a reader study where an expert This approach, achieving an F1-Score of 0.91 on a diverse dataset, aims to enhance the ability of both experts and citizens to detect microplastic in water across diverse ecological contexts, thereby improving the cost and accessibility of microplastic analysis.
